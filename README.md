This is a project I made using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, where I built an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in which you can hover over a square to show in a fainter
shade the X or O you are going to put there, as well as making a sound when someone places an X or an O and when the game ends. If a player wins or if
the game is drawn, the game has the option to be restarted and, if someone wins, they gain a point in the scoreboard at the bottom of the website.
